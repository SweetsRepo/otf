A utility for pulling data from your Orange Theory account for better data analysis

### This script will currently display
* \# of classes by coach
* Breakdown of class types you have taken
* Your home studio
* \# of classes booked
* \# of classes attended (including those without a HRM)
* \# of intro classes taken
* \# OT Live classes booked
* \# OT Live classes attended
* \# Total classes used HRM
* \# Total studios visited
* \# Max HR (what would show at 100% on the screen)
* Average Max HR across classes
* Average HR across classes
* Average splats
* Average calorie burn
* A min by min breakdown of your average HR
* Average time in each HR zone

The script currently makes a lot of assumptions about what data will be available. Since I only had access to my account I was able to make those assumptions, but some folks had different data that didn't quite match mine, or had data missing.
